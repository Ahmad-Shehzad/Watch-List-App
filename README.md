An android application to store and view your film and tv show recommendations.

This application takes user input of a film/tv show, looks up the entry in The Movie Database via their API, finds the best match and stores the details in a SQL database.

The application has three features:
  
  - View your list of films and tv shows
  - Generate a random film from your list, displaying the relevant poster
  - Generate a random tv show from your list

Additionally you are able to remove items from your list.


Posters provided by TMDb (The Movie Database)
